# Mobile Currency Exchange System

This project is a mobile app that lets users check currency exchange rates and trade virtual money. It keeps everything simple and easy to use.

## How it works

The app is built with **React Native** and uses **Expo** to run. This makes it easy to test on both iOS, Android and web. We also use TypeScript to keep the code clean and safe.

## How to run the project

To get started, follow these steps:

1.  Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  Start the project:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

Once the server is running, you can:
*   Press **i** to open it on the iOS simulator.
*   Press **a** to open it on the Android emulator.
*   Press **w** to open it on the web.

## About the Project

This app is built for the **Network communication in mobile application development W1** class, taught by **Professor Marcin Kacprowicz**.
